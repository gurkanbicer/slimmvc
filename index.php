/**
 * SlimMVC
 * It provides an MVC structure for SlimPHP (Slim Framework).
 *
 * Basically, all of the frameworks are provides a fast development environment. But, SlimPHP (Slim Framework) is a
 * micro framework and it becomes with minimal features like the routing, the request, and the response interfaces.
 * It hasn't an MVC structure. When you want to use SlimPHP and MVC structure, you should add all of the dependencies
 * as manually. It's tiring and it doesn't provide entirety.
 *
 * We got inspired by Laravel and CodeIgniter, and we prepared this environment for who likes the SlimPHP and working 
 * at the MVC structure.
